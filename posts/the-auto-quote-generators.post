An Automatic Quote Generator - generates sound bites that *almost* sound like someone else, and are somtimes funny as hell:

- [AutoFreya][1], emulating the [doubtfully-anonymous-teen Freya][2]
- [AutoLG][3], for popular blogger [Louis Gray][4]
- [AutoMona][5], for, well, I can't describe who [Mona][6] is yet. I haven't figured out. Just someone cool, maybe?
- [AutoAtwood][7], for one of the few for-the-masses dev coder [Jeff Atwood][8]

A few of them ([@AutoLG][9] & [@AutoMona][10]) also have twiwtter bots for them, posting short tweets once every seven minutes.

And ofcourse, I open sourced [the code][11] for all this - and made it available on github :)
