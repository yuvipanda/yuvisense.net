No, I'm *not* going to blow your mind by telling you I'm going to do the SICP exercises in BrainFuck :) 

I just wrote [my first brainfuck program][1]. Might as well be my last, but not sure. Tape-based turing-ish programing seems fun, so maybe I'll try that again with something more expressive than brainfuck (or maybe that is pointless?)

And I'm doing the SICP Exercises. In [MIT-Scheme][2]. I've put them [up on GitHub][3]. I'm doing this with the [FPUG-C][fpug] SICP Study Group, so hope I'm able to complete it all this time :) Big props to [Balaji][4] for organizing it, and letting us get away with the free coke and coffee!
